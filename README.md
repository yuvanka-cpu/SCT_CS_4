### SkillCraft Technology

This project focuses on creating a basic and ethical keyboard activity monitor for educational purposes.  
The tool records keyboard input **only within the program itself**, ensuring user privacy and responsible usage.

## 📘 Project Description

The goal of this task is to:

- Capture key presses **only when typed inside the application window**
- Display or save the captured keys to a file for learning purposes
- Understand how keyboard events work in programming
- Practice safe, responsible, and ethical handling of input data

⚠️ **Note:**  
This project does *not* involve creating hidden keyloggers or spying tools.  
All logging should occur with full user knowledge and consent.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The program listens for keyboard events.  
2. Each key pressed by the user (inside the program) is recorded or displayed.  
3. Optionally, the keys can be saved to a text file.  
4. The user always knows when the program is running and capturing input.
